# HoopsLink: Database Design Capstone Project

## Description

For my capstone project, I will design and implement a cutting-edge platform called HoopsLink, a one-stop hub crafted to serve the comprehensive demands of basketball enthusiasts across all proficiency tiers. Nestled in the heart of a vibrant city with a rich basketball heritage, HoopsLink aims to elevate the local basketball scene by bridging the gap between coaches, players, and essential basketball gear providers.

Envisioned as a multi-faceted ecosystem, HoopsLink will streamline the connection between basketball aficionados and the resources they require to excel. The platform will encompass various services, such as personalized coaching sessions, gear procurement, and a review system that fosters a culture of continuous improvement and feedback. Whether one is taking their first dribble or preparing for professional leagues, HoopsLink is tailored to assist in their basketball journey. The cornerstone of HoopsLink is a bespoke database system that underpins the seamless operation of the platform. The database will not only handle intricate data relationships like linking players to coaches and orders to equipment but also empower users with intuitive views tailored to their specific roles. These views will enable customers to manage their profiles, schedule coaching sessions, order gear, and track payments efficiently and easily. Furthermore, coaches will be able to monitor their schedules, receive performance reviews, and interact with clients effectively.
